<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

There are many video calling applications around the globe, but they are mostly server based applications providing maximum load on the server, wherein the audio and video quality decreases with increase in the number of participants. Many don't even support end-to-end encryption.

So we decided to develop a one-stop solution for not only addressing all these solution, but to give a seamless experience to the user. Distrideo Chat is a distributed video/audio conferencing application, which is designed to work on the edge, with very less interference of the server(i.e. peer to peer connection). It is designed to work efficiently on all platforms.
